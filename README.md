AI Testing with TypeScript and CodeceptJS
Overview
This project leverages CodeceptJS with TypeScript to automate the testing of AI models and systems. The aim of this testing setup is to validate the correctness, robustness, and performance of AI functionalities, ensuring the models perform accurately under a variety of conditions and user interactions.

Objectives
The main objectives of AI testing in this project include:

Functional Validation: Ensuring the AI system produces accurate and expected results.
Performance Testing: Verifying the system's performance under load and in real-time scenarios.
Robustness: Testing the model's ability to handle edge cases and unexpected inputs.
Bias Detection: Evaluating the fairness of the AI model to ensure no biased behavior.
User Interaction Testing: Simulating user interaction to validate how the AI reacts to dynamic inputs.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14+)
CodeceptJS
TypeScript
AI model (deployed or local)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Sao chép mã
git clone <repo-url>
Install the dependencies:

bash
Sao chép mã
npm install
Install CodeceptJS with TypeScript support:

bash
Sao chép mã
npx codeceptjs init
Add additional dependencies for AI testing, such as tools to interact with the model (if applicable).

Configuration
Configure CodeceptJS by modifying the codecept.conf.ts file. Here's an example setup:

typescript
Sao chép mã
exports.config = {
  tests: './tests/**/*.ts',
  output: './output',
  helpers: {
    Playwright: {
      url: 'http://localhost',
      show: true,
      browser: 'chromium'
    }
  },
  include: {
    I: './steps_file.ts'
  },
  bootstrap: null,
  mocha: {},
  name: 'ai-testing',
  plugins: {
    screenshotOnFail: {
      enabled: true
    }
  }
};
Writing Tests
Create AI-specific test cases in the tests folder. Below is a basic test example:

typescript
Sao chép mã
Feature('AI Model Validation');

Scenario('Test AI model output for given input', ({ I }) => {
  I.amOnPage('/ai-endpoint');
  I.fillField('Input', 'Sample data');
  I.click('Submit');
  I.see('Expected output', '.output-class');
});
Running Tests
To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Sao chép mã
npx codeceptjs run --steps
Performance Testing
For performance testing, consider using a combination of CodeceptJS with performance profiling tools. You can automate user flows and measure response times under load.

Conclusion
By integrating CodeceptJS with TypeScript, this setup enables automated testing for AI systems. It ensures that the AI models are functioning correctly, scalable, and unbiased under various conditions, while also simulating real user interactions.
